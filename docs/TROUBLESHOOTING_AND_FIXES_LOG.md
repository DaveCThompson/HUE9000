This section details issues addressed during and immediately after the V2.3 refactor, which componentized Button and Dial management.

### C.1. Dial B Intensity Snap-to-Zero on First Interaction Post-Startup
*   **Symptom:** After the startup sequence completed (P3 - Lens activated to 25% power), the first user interaction (drag) with Dial B (Intensity) caused the lens's visual intensity to snap to 0% before responding to the drag from the expected 25% starting point.
*   **Root Cause Analysis:**
    1.  A `TypeError` (`this.targets is not a function`) occurred in the `onComplete` callback of the GSAP tween within `lensManager.energizeLensCoreStartup`. This happened because `this` inside the `onComplete` (when not an arrow function and not explicitly bound) referred to the tween itself, but the attempt to get `this.targets()[0].value` was problematic or the `lensPowerProxy` was not accessed correctly.
    2.  This error prevented the execution of subsequent code in the `onComplete` callback, which was responsible for updating `appState.dials.B` (specifically its `hue` and `targetHue`) to correspond to the 25% lens power achieved during startup.
    3.  As a result, when the `Dial.js` instance for Dial B handled the first user interaction, it read an initial `hue: 0` and `targetHue: 0` from `appState.dials.B` (its default constructed state), causing the interaction and visual lens power to start from 0% instead of the intended 25%.
*   **Solution Implemented:**
    1.  Corrected the `onComplete` callback in `lensManager.energizeLensCoreStartup` to directly access the `lensPowerProxy.value` (which was in its lexical scope) instead of relying on `this.targets()`.
    2.  Ensured that this `onComplete` callback now reliably updates `appState.dials.B` with `hue`, `targetHue`, `rotation`, and `targetRotation` values that accurately reflect the 25% lens power set during startup.
*   **Files Affected:** `src/js/lensManager.js`.
*   **Key Learning:** Careful management of `this` context in GSAP callbacks is crucial. Accessing variables from the outer scope (if available) or ensuring correct binding can prevent such errors. Synchronizing all related state aspects (e.g., lens power and the controlling dial's hue) is vital for consistent UI behavior.

### C.2. Lens Incorrectly Visible During Startup Idle Phase (P0)
*   **Symptom:** The lens displayed a minimal glow during the P0_Baseline phase of startup, when it should have been completely invisible.
*   **Root Cause Analysis:** The logic in `lensManager._updateLensGradientVisuals` was setting the lens `opacity` to `1` if the `appStatus` was not `loading` or `error`. During P0, `appStatus` is `starting-up`. Even if `trueLensPower` was 0, this condition led to `opacity: 1` being applied, making the base gradient (BP0) visible.
*   **Solution Implemented:**
    *   Modified `lensManager._updateLensGradientVisuals` to set lens `opacity: 0` and `background: none` under more specific initial conditions: if `appStatus` is `loading`, OR if `appStatus` is `starting-up` AND `currentVisualPower` is effectively zero (and Dial B's initial hue is also zero). This ensures the lens remains off until P3_Lens explicitly activates it by setting opacity to 1 and ramping up power.
    *   Ensured that once `appStatus` is `interactive` or during P3 activation onwards (and not `error`), the lens opacity is maintained at `1`, with its visual intensity solely determined by the calculated gradient.
*   **Files Affected:** `src/js/lensManager.js`.

### C.3. Body Opacity Incorrectly Zero on Initial Load in Debug/Step-Through Mode
*   **Symptom:** The entire UI was invisible (body opacity was 0) when the application loaded in step-through debug mode, requiring a "Play All" or stepping past P1 to become visible.
*   **Root Cause Analysis:** The `startupSequenceManager.start()` function had logic that could lead to `body.opacity` being set to 0 via `resetVisualsAndState(false, ...)` if `isStepThroughMode` was false, but the subsequent handling for `isStepThroughMode = true` in `start()` wasn't overriding this correctly or consistently before the user could see the page.
*   **Solution Implemented:**
    *   Simplified the body opacity setting in `startupSequenceManager.start()`. The initial `body.opacity` (0 for auto-play, 1 for step-through) is now more clearly and solely determined by the call to `resetVisualsAndState(isStepThroughMode, ...)`.
    *   `resetVisualsAndState` now reliably sets `gsap.set(domElementsRegistry.body, { opacity: forStepping ? 1 : 0 });`.
    *   If auto-playing (`!isStepThroughMode`), `GsapPhase1_BodyFadeIn` is responsible for animating opacity from 0 to 1. If stepping (`isStepThroughMode`), opacity starts at 1.
*   **Files Affected:** `src/js/startupSequenceManager.js`.

### C.4. (Minor) ButtonManager Import Casing Error
*   **Symptom:** TypeScript or linter error in VS Code due to inconsistent casing in the import statement for `Button.js` within `buttonManager.js`.
*   **Root Cause Analysis:** File system was likely case-insensitive, but the development environment's tooling was case-sensitive or configured for strict casing. The import `import Button from './button.js'` did not match the actual filename `Button.js`.
*   **Solution Implemented:** Corrected the import statement in `buttonManager.js` to `import Button from './Button.js';`.
*   **Files Affected:** `src/js/buttonManager.js`.

### C.5. P6 Button Energizing Failure: SCAN/HUE_ASSN/FIT_EVAL Buttons Not Transitioning from 'is-dimly-lit'
*   **Symptom:** During the P6 startup phase, SCAN, HUE ASSN, and FIT EVAL buttons, which were set to `is-dimly-lit` in P4, fail to flicker and transition to their `is-energized` state. The console log from `buttonManager.flickerDimlyLitToEnergizedStartup` shows "Total buttons to energize: 0".
*   **Root Cause Analysis (Fragility Identified):**
    1.  In P4, `startupSequenceManager` calls `buttonManager.smoothTransitionButtonsToState`, which uses `gsap.timeline().call()` to schedule `Button.setState(ButtonStates.DIMLY_LIT, ...)` for the relevant buttons. Console logs from within `Button.setState` confirm that `buttonInstance.currentClasses` *is* updated to include `is-dimly-lit` when these GSAP calls execute.
    2.  In the *current (problematic)* `startupSequenceManager.GsapPhase6_ThemeTransitionAndFinalEnergize`, the call to `managerInstances.buttonManager.flickerDimlyLitToEnergizedStartup(...)` happens *synchronously* when the P6 phase's GSAP timeline is being *built*.
    3.  The `flickerDimlyLitToEnergizedStartup` method itself iterates through `buttonManager._buttons` *synchronously at the time it is called* to determine which buttons are currently `is-dimly-lit` and should be included in the flicker animation timeline it *returns*.
    4.  **The Fragility:** This synchronous check during the P6 timeline *build phase* occurs *before* the P6 `appStateService.setTheme('dark')` call (and its subsequent synchronous event listeners like `uiUpdater.handleThemeChange` and `toggleManager.syncLightToggleToThemeVisuals`) has executed. While P4's `setState` calls *should* have completed, the timing of the P6 build phase check is too early relative to the overall sequence flow and dependencies. The old (working) version deferred the *invocation* of the equivalent button energizing logic until the P6 GSAP timeline was actually playing at the appropriate point, by wrapping it in a `gsap.call()`.
    5.  As a result, when `flickerDimlyLitToEnergizedStartup` inspects the `buttonInstance.currentClasses`, it does not find `is-dimly-lit` for the target buttons.
*   **Solution Implemented (Planned & Executed):**
    1.  Modified `startupSequenceManager.GsapPhase6_ThemeTransitionAndFinalEnergize` to defer the *invocation* of `managerInstances.buttonManager.flickerDimlyLitToEnergizedStartup`.
    2.  This was achieved by creating a new sub-timeline within P6 (`energizeButtonsSubTimeline`). This sub-timeline contains a `gsap.call()` that, when executed, *then* calls `flickerDimlyLitToEnergizedStartup`.
    3.  The timeline returned by `flickerDimlyLitToEnergizedStartup` (containing the actual flicker animations) is then added to this `energizeButtonsSubTimeline`.
    4.  The `energizeButtonsSubTimeline` is scheduled within the main P6 timeline at a point (`energizeStartTime`) that ensures the P4 states are set and the P6 theme change has been initiated and processed by relevant listeners.
*   **Files Affected:** `src/js/startupSequenceManager.js`.
*   **Key Learning:** The distinction between when a function that *builds* a GSAP timeline is called (and performs its state checks) versus when the *resulting timeline actually plays* is critical for complex, state-dependent sequences. State checks should occur at the point of GSAP execution if they depend on prior GSAP-driven state changes.

## Overall Current Learnings & Best Practices (from V2.3 Refactor)

*   **Component State Synchronization:** The internal state of components (e.g., `Button.currentClasses`, `Dial`'s reflection of `appState`) must be the single source of truth for their logic, and methods like `setState` must reliably update both this JS state and the corresponding DOM attributes/classes.
*   **Clear State Dependencies:** When one piece of state (e.g., `trueLensPower`) implies another (e.g., Dial B's `hue`), ensure mechanisms are in place to keep them synchronized, especially after programmatic changes like startup sequences.
*   **GSAP Callback Context & Timing:** Be mindful of `this` context within GSAP callbacks. Arrow functions can help maintain lexical scope. Crucially, understand that calling a function that *builds* a GSAP timeline executes its internal logic (including state checks) *at build time*, not necessarily at playback time unless explicitly deferred using mechanisms like `gsap.call()`.
*   **Startup Sequence Robustness:** Initial visibility and state of all elements must be rigorously controlled. Defer state-dependent animation setup until precedent state changes are guaranteed to have occurred within the GSAP sequence.

This section details issues addressed during and immediately after the V2.3 refactor, which componentized Button and Dial management.

### C.1. Dial B Intensity Snap-to-Zero on First Interaction Post-Startup
*   **Symptom:** After the startup sequence completed (P3 - Lens activated to 25% power), the first user interaction (drag) with Dial B (Intensity) caused the lens's visual intensity to snap to 0% before responding to the drag from the expected 25% starting point.
*   **Root Cause Analysis:**
    1.  A `TypeError` (`this.targets is not a function`) occurred in the `onComplete` callback of the GSAP tween within `lensManager.energizeLensCoreStartup`. This happened because `this` inside the `onComplete` (when not an arrow function and not explicitly bound) referred to the tween itself, but the attempt to get `this.targets()[0].value` was problematic or the `lensPowerProxy` was not accessed correctly.
    2.  This error prevented the execution of subsequent code in the `onComplete` callback, which was responsible for updating `appState.dials.B` (specifically its `hue` and `targetHue`) to correspond to the 25% lens power achieved during startup.
    3.  As a result, when the `Dial.js` instance for Dial B handled the first user interaction, it read an initial `hue: 0` and `targetHue: 0` from `appState.dials.B` (its default constructed state), causing the interaction and visual lens power to start from 0% instead of the intended 25%.
*   **Solution Implemented:**
    1.  Corrected the `onComplete` callback in `lensManager.energizeLensCoreStartup` to directly access the `lensPowerProxy.value` (which was in its lexical scope) instead of relying on `this.targets()`.
    2.  Ensured that this `onComplete` callback now reliably updates `appState.dials.B` with `hue`, `targetHue`, `rotation`, and `targetRotation` values that accurately reflect the 25% lens power set during startup.
*   **Files Affected:** `src/js/lensManager.js`.
*   **Key Learning:** Careful management of `this` context in GSAP callbacks is crucial. Accessing variables from the outer scope (if available) or ensuring correct binding can prevent such errors. Synchronizing all related state aspects (e.g., lens power and the controlling dial's hue) is vital for consistent UI behavior.

### C.2. Lens Incorrectly Visible During Startup Idle Phase (P0)
*   **Symptom:** The lens displayed a minimal glow during the P0_Baseline phase of startup, when it should have been completely invisible.
*   **Root Cause Analysis:** The logic in `lensManager._updateLensGradientVisuals` was setting the lens `opacity` to `1` if the `appStatus` was not `loading` or `error`. During P0, `appStatus` is `starting-up`. Even if `trueLensPower` was 0, this condition led to `opacity: 1` being applied, making the base gradient (BP0) visible.
*   **Solution Implemented:**
    *   Modified `lensManager._updateLensGradientVisuals` to set lens `opacity: 0` and `background: none` under more specific initial conditions: if `appStatus` is `loading`, OR if `appStatus` is `starting-up` AND `currentVisualPower` is effectively zero (and Dial B's initial hue is also zero). This ensures the lens remains off until P3_Lens explicitly activates it by setting opacity to 1 and ramping up power.
    *   Ensured that once `appStatus` is `interactive` or during P3 activation onwards (and not `error`), the lens opacity is maintained at `1`, with its visual intensity solely determined by the calculated gradient.
*   **Files Affected:** `src/js/lensManager.js`.

### C.3. Body Opacity Incorrectly Zero on Initial Load in Debug/Step-Through Mode
*   **Symptom:** The entire UI was invisible (body opacity was 0) when the application loaded in step-through debug mode, requiring a "Play All" or stepping past P1 to become visible.
*   **Root Cause Analysis:** The `startupSequenceManager.start()` function had logic that could lead to `body.opacity` being set to 0 via `resetVisualsAndState(false, ...)` if `isStepThroughMode` was false, but the subsequent handling for `isStepThroughMode = true` in `start()` wasn't overriding this correctly or consistently before the user could see the page.
*   **Solution Implemented:**
    *   Simplified the body opacity setting in `startupSequenceManager.start()`. The initial `body.opacity` (0 for auto-play, 1 for step-through) is now more clearly and solely determined by the call to `resetVisualsAndState(isStepThroughMode, ...)`.
    *   `resetVisualsAndState` now reliably sets `gsap.set(domElementsRegistry.body, { opacity: forStepping ? 1 : 0 });`.
    *   If auto-playing (`!isStepThroughMode`), `GsapPhase1_BodyFadeIn` is responsible for animating opacity from 0 to 1. If stepping (`isStepThroughMode`), opacity starts at 1.
*   **Files Affected:** `src/js/startupSequenceManager.js`.

### C.4. (Minor) ButtonManager Import Casing Error
*   **Symptom:** TypeScript or linter error in VS Code due to inconsistent casing in the import statement for `Button.js` within `buttonManager.js`.
*   **Root Cause Analysis:** File system was likely case-insensitive, but the development environment's tooling was case-sensitive or configured for strict casing. The import `import Button from './button.js'` did not match the actual filename `Button.js`.
*   **Solution Implemented:** Corrected the import statement in `buttonManager.js` to `import Button from './Button.js';`.
*   **Files Affected:** `src/js/buttonManager.js`.

### C.5. P6 Button Energizing Failure: SCAN/HUE_ASSN/FIT_EVAL Buttons Not Transitioning from 'is-dimly-lit'
*   **Symptom:** During the P6 startup phase, SCAN, HUE ASSN, and FIT EVAL buttons, which were set to `is-dimly-lit` in P4, fail to flicker and transition to their `is-energized` state. The console log from `buttonManager.flickerDimlyLitToEnergizedStartup` shows "Total buttons to energize: 0".
*   **Root Cause Analysis (Fragility Identified):**
    1.  In P4, `startupSequenceManager` calls `buttonManager.smoothTransitionButtonsToState`, which uses `gsap.timeline().call()` to schedule `Button.setState(ButtonStates.DIMLY_LIT, ...)` for the relevant buttons. Console logs from within `Button.setState` confirm that `buttonInstance.currentClasses` *is* updated to include `is-dimly-lit` when these GSAP calls execute.
    2.  In the *current (problematic)* `startupSequenceManager.GsapPhase6_ThemeTransitionAndFinalEnergize`, the call to `managerInstances.buttonManager.flickerDimlyLitToEnergizedStartup(...)` happens *synchronously* when the P6 phase's GSAP timeline is being *built*.
    3.  The `flickerDimlyLitToEnergizedStartup` method itself iterates through `buttonManager._buttons` *synchronously at the time it is called* to determine which buttons are currently `is-dimly-lit` and should be included in the flicker animation timeline it *returns*.
    4.  **The Fragility:** This synchronous check during the P6 timeline *build phase* occurs *before* the P6 `appStateService.setTheme('dark')` call (and its subsequent synchronous event listeners like `uiUpdater.handleThemeChange` and `toggleManager.syncLightToggleToThemeVisuals`) has executed. While P4's `setState` calls *should* have completed, the timing of the P6 build phase check is too early relative to the overall sequence flow and dependencies. The old (working) version deferred the *invocation* of the equivalent button energizing logic until the P6 GSAP timeline was actually playing at the appropriate point, by wrapping it in a `gsap.call()`.
    5.  As a result, when `flickerDimlyLitToEnergizedStartup` inspects the `buttonInstance.currentClasses`, it does not find `is-dimly-lit` for the target buttons.
*   **Solution Implemented (Planned & Executed):**
    1.  Modified `startupSequenceManager.GsapPhase6_ThemeTransitionAndFinalEnergize` to defer the *invocation* of `managerInstances.buttonManager.flickerDimlyLitToEnergizedStartup`.
    2.  This was achieved by creating a new sub-timeline within P6 (`energizeButtonsSubTimeline`). This sub-timeline contains a `gsap.call()` that, when executed, *then* calls `flickerDimlyLitToEnergizedStartup`.
    3.  The timeline returned by `flickerDimlyLitToEnergizedStartup` (containing the actual flicker animations) is then added to this `energizeButtonsSubTimeline`.
    4.  The `energizeButtonsSubTimeline` is scheduled within the main P6 timeline at a point (`energizeStartTime`) that ensures the P4 states are set and the P6 theme change has been initiated and processed by relevant listeners.
*   **Files Affected:** `src/js/startupSequenceManager.js`.
*   **Key Learning:** The distinction between when a function that *builds* a GSAP timeline is called (and performs its state checks) versus when the *resulting timeline actually plays* is critical for complex, state-dependent sequences. State checks should occur at the point of GSAP execution if they depend on prior GSAP-driven state changes.

### C.6. GSAP Instance Management and Plugin Registration (Critical Fix)
*   **Symptom Series:**
    1.  Initial errors: `Invalid property autoAlpha set to ... Missing plugin? gsap.registerPlugin()`.
    2.  After attempting to fix by removing CDN and relying on `window.gsap`: `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'set')` in `Button.js` (where `this.gsap` was undefined).
    3.  After passing `gsap` to `ButtonManager` and then to `Button` constructor: `ReferenceError: gsap is not defined` in `animationUtils.js`.
*   **Root Cause Analysis:**
    1.  **`autoAlpha` Error:** When using GSAP with a module bundler like Vite, relying solely on CDN-based global registration of GSAP and its plugins is unreliable. The bundler might not correctly "see" or link these global instances with module-imported GSAP, or tree-shaking could interfere. `autoAlpha` is part of CSSPlugin, which is usually core but its registration needs to be solid.
    2.  **`this.gsap` Undefined in `Button.js`:** `ButtonManager` was importing its own `gsap` instance but not passing it to the `Button` constructor. The `Button` constructor's fallback to `window.gsap` was unreliable during the synchronous initialization phase.
    3.  **`gsap` Undefined in `animationUtils.js`:** This utility module was attempting to use a global `gsap` variable directly, which was no longer reliably available after removing the CDN and before a proper import was added to the utility itself.
*   **Solution Implemented (Iterative):**
    1.  **Centralized GSAP Setup (`main.js`):**
        *   Removed GSAP CDN `<script>` tags from `index.html`.
        *   Installed `gsap` as an npm dependency (`npm install gsap`).
        *   In `main.js`, explicitly imported `gsap` and necessary plugins (e.g., `TextPlugin`) from the `gsap` package:
            ```javascript
            import { gsap } from "gsap";
            import { TextPlugin } from "gsap/TextPlugin";
            gsap.registerPlugin(TextPlugin);
            ```
        *   This configured `gsap` instance from `main.js` is now the single source of truth.
    2.  **Dependency Injection:**
        *   The configured `gsap` instance from `main.js` is explicitly passed to the `init` methods of all managers that require it (`buttonManager`, `dialManager`, `lensManager`, `terminalManager`, `startupSequenceManager`, `uiUpdater`).
        *   Managers that create component instances (like `ButtonManager` creating `Button`s, or `DialManager` creating `Dial`s) are responsible for passing this `gsap` instance to their component constructors.
        *   Example (`ButtonManager`):
            ```javascript
            // buttonManager.js
            init(buttonElements, gsapInstance) {
                this.gsap = gsapInstance;
                // ...
            }
            addButton(element, ...) {
                const buttonConfig = { ..., gsapInstance: this.gsap }; // Pass gsapInstance in config
                const buttonInstance = new Button(element, buttonConfig); // Button constructor extracts it
                // ...
            }
            ```
        *   Example (`Button.js` constructor):
            ```javascript
            constructor(domElement, config, gsapInstance, /*...other deps*/) { // gsapInstance passed directly
                this.gsap = gsapInstance;
                if (!this.gsap) throw new Error("GSAP instance not provided to Button constructor");
                // ...
            }
            ```
    3.  **Direct Import in Utilities (`animationUtils.js`):**
        *   For standalone utility modules like `animationUtils.js` that are not class-based managers, directly importing `gsap` is the cleanest approach:
            ```javascript
            // animationUtils.js
            import { gsap } from "gsap";
            // ... use gsap directly ...
            ```
*   **Files Affected:** `index.html`, `main.js`, `buttonManager.js`, `Button.js`, `animationUtils.js`, `dialManager.js`, `Dial.js`, `lensManager.js`, `terminalManager.js`, `startupSequenceManager.js`, `uiUpdater.js`.
*   **Key Learning & Best Practice for GSAP with Vite/Module Bundlers:**
    *   **NPM Installation:** Always install GSAP via npm/yarn.
    *   **Central Import & Registration:** Import `gsap` and register all required plugins (like `TextPlugin`, `ScrollTrigger`, etc.) once in your main application entry point (e.g., `main.js`). This ensures all plugins are available to the GSAP instance used throughout the application.
    *   **Explicit Dependency:**
        *   For manager classes or components, pass the configured `gsap` instance via their `init` method or constructor. Store it as `this.gsap` and use that for all GSAP calls. This makes the dependency clear and avoids reliance on potentially unreliable globals.
        *   For utility functions or modules that aren't class instances, importing `gsap` directly within that module is acceptable and often cleaner.
    *   **Avoid `window.gsap`:** Do not rely on `window.gsap` as the primary way to access GSAP in a bundled environment. While it might sometimes work, it's less robust and can lead to the types of errors encountered. The imported `gsap` object is the canonical reference.
    *   **CSSPlugin:** `CSSPlugin` (which handles `autoAlpha` and most DOM animations) is part of the GSAP core and is automatically registered when you import `gsap`. Explicit registration is usually not needed unless specific bundler issues arise. The `autoAlpha` errors were symptomatic of GSAP itself not being correctly available/configured, not necessarily a missing CSSPlugin registration *if GSAP itself was working*.

### C.7. LCD and Terminal Text/Background Flickering Issues During Startup
*   **Symptoms:**
    1.  **Terminal Text (P1-P5):** Text visible from P1 would briefly flicker off and on when transitioning to subsequent early phases (P2-P5).
    2.  **Dial LCDs (P6):** Dial LCDs would flash on with their `lcd--dimly-lit` styles, then immediately turn off (due to `autoAlpha:0` from their flicker profile), and then flicker on as intended.
    3.  **Dial LCD Backgrounds (P10):** During the theme transition to `theme-dark`, the backgrounds of Dial LCDs would briefly flicker off (become transparent) while their text remained visible.
*   **Root Cause Analysis:**
    1.  **Terminal Text (P1-P5 Flicker):** `uiUpdater.applyInitialLcdStates()`, called on phase changes, was setting `#terminal-lcd-content` opacity to 0 for phases P0-P5 (as the parent screen was `lcd--unlit`). `terminalManager` would then quickly set it back to 1 when processing a new message, causing a rapid off/on flicker.
    2.  **Dial LCDs (P6 Flash On/Off/On):**
        *   `uiUpdater.applyInitialLcdStates()` (triggered by P6 start) would first apply `lcd--dimly-lit` class and styles *without* flicker, making the LCDs visible (Flash ON).
        *   Then, `startupPhase6.js` would call `uiUpdater.setLcdState()` again for the same LCDs, but *with* the `lcdScreenFlickerToDimlyLit` profile. This profile starts with `amplitudeStart: 0.0`, causing `createAdvancedFlicker` to immediately `gsap.set(lcdElement, { autoAlpha: 0 })` (Flash OFF).
        *   The flicker animation would then proceed from `autoAlpha:0` (Flicker ON).
    3.  **Dial LCD Backgrounds (P10 Flicker-Off):** This was attributed to a CSS transition artifact. When `theme-dim` is removed and `theme-dark` is added, the CSS variables defining the `background-image` gradient change. If the browser doesn't smoothly interpolate the gradient or if there's no solid `background-color` fallback, the gradient might momentarily fail to render, appearing transparent.
*   **Solutions Implemented (Iterative):**
    1.  **Terminal Text (P1-P5):** Modified `uiUpdater.updateLcdTextAndVisibility` to *not* set `#terminal-lcd-content` opacity to 0 if it already contains child elements (lines of text), even if its parent screen is `lcd--unlit`.
    2.  **Dial LCDs (P6):**
        *   Modified `uiUpdater.applyInitialLcdStates` to *not* call `setLcdState` for Dial LCDs A and B if `currentPhase === 6`. This allows `startupPhase6.js` to be the sole initiator of their transition to `lcd--dimly-lit` *with* flicker.
        *   In `uiUpdater.setLcdState`, when `useFlicker` is true and the flicker profile starts from unlit (like `lcdScreenFlickerToDimlyLit`), `gsap.set(screenElement, { autoAlpha: 0, immediateRender: true })` is now called *before* the target class (e.g., `lcd--dimly-lit`) is applied. This prevents the class styles from rendering the element visible just before GSAP hides it for the flicker.
    3.  **Dial LCD Backgrounds (P10):**
        *   Added a `background-color` property to the base `.hue-lcd-display` (and `.actual-lcd-screen-element`) style in `_lcd.css`. This color is derived from the darkest stop of its own `background-image` gradient variables. This provides a solid fallback if the gradient momentarily fails to render during the CSS theme transition. The `background-color` itself also transitions.
        *   Ensured `uiUpdater.handleThemeChange` defers `applyInitialLcdStates` during the P10 CSS transition.
        *   `startupPhase10.js` explicitly calls `uiUpdater.applyInitialLcdStates()` after a short delay *after* `setTheme('dark')` to help stabilize the final 'active' state under the new theme.
*   **Files Affected:** `src/js/uiUpdater.js`, `src/js/config.js` (new flicker profile for terminal screen), `src/js/startupPhase6.js` (to use new terminal screen flicker profile), `src/css/components/_lcd.css` (added `background-color`), `src/js/startupPhase10.js` (added delayed call to `applyInitialLcdStates`).
*   **Key Learnings:**
    *   The order of operations (class application vs. GSAP `autoAlpha` sets) is critical for elements that flicker from an unlit state. GSAP should make the element invisible *before* any class that would make it visible is applied.
    *   CSS transitions on complex properties like `background-image` (especially gradients driven by multiple CSS variables) can sometimes have rendering artifacts during theme switches. Providing a solid `background-color` fallback can mitigate visual glitches.
    *   Carefully consider the responsibilities of different functions that might affect the same element's state (e.g., `applyInitialLcdStates` vs. phase-specific logic) to avoid conflicting or redundant operations that can cause flashes.
    *   When an element's container (like the terminal screen) is animated, ensure its content's visibility is managed independently if the content should persist (e.g., terminal text should not disappear if only its screen background is flickering on).

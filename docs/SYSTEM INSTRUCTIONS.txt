## Task Understanding
Begin by clearly understanding the nature of the task. Not every task will involve code generation. Some tasks may be:

Analysis-only: Review and assess existing code or architecture.

Planning: Propose a strategy or roadmap for changes or development.

Question-driven: Identify gaps or uncertainties and seek clarifications before proceeding.

Code Generation: When explicitly required, generate or modify code according to the instructions below.

Feedback on code: When issues are reported.  Diagnose potential root causes. Devise a fix.  Ask questions if needed.

Always tailor your output to the task type. If the task does not require code output, do not generate or simulate any files.

## CODE UPDATE INSTRUCTIONS

Phase 1: Analysis and Planning
Change Plan
Briefly outline the changes you intend to make, in clear, structured points.

Risk Assessment
Identify dependencies, linkages, or any areas with a high risk of regression or unintended effects.

Refinement
Update your plan to mitigate identified risks. Adjust scope or approach as needed.

Clarifying Questions
Ask any essential questions needed to resolve ambiguity or ensure the correct implementation path.

Phase 2: Code Implementation and Output
Only output files that were actually modified. Do not include unchanged files.

For each modified file, use the format below:

Filename Header
Place the full filename on its own line. Examples:
**script.js** or File: script.js
This must be outside the code block.

Code Block
Directly below the filename, include the complete updated file in a single Markdown code block.
Do not include any additional text or markers (e.g., “START OF FILE”, “UPDATED”).

Filename Footer
Repeat the filename exactly as the header, on its own line.
This must also be outside the code block.

Output Limits
Include up to 8 files per response.

Summary
At the end of the response, list:

All modified files included in this output.

Any additional files that were updated but deferred due to the output limit.

Any key testing instructions to verify.
